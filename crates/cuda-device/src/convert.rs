//! Type conversion intrinsics.
//!
//! These intrinsics provide access to PTX type conversion instructions that
//! are more efficient than scalar Rust casts.

/// Convert two f32 values to a packed f16x2 (u32) in a single instruction.
///
/// This is equivalent to:
/// ```ignore
/// ((lo as f16).to_bits() as u32) | (((hi as f16).to_bits() as u32) << 16)
/// ```
/// but compiles to a single `cvt.rn.f16x2.f32` PTX instruction instead of
/// two separate f32→f16 conversions plus bit manipulation.
///
/// Maps to PTX: `cvt.rn.f16x2.f32 d, hi, lo;`
///
/// Lane placement: the first argument (`lo`) fills bits `[15:0]` and the
/// second argument (`hi`) fills bits `[31:16]`, even though the PTX
/// operand list prints `hi` first. This is the same first-arg-low
/// convention as [`cvt_f32x2_bf16x2`](crate::tcgen05::cvt_f32x2_bf16x2),
/// which differs only in its destination element type (bf16, not f16)
/// and its `a`/`b` argument naming.
///
/// # Arguments
/// - `lo`: f32 value for the low 16 bits (bits `[15:0]`)
/// - `hi`: f32 value for the high 16 bits (bits `[31:16]`)
///
/// # Returns
/// A u32 containing two packed f16 values.
